# Employee Privacy Survey - Video Demonstration Script

## Duration: 1 Minute

---

## Scene 1: Introduction (0:00-0:12)
**Visual**: Show the web application homepage with the title "Employee Privacy Survey System"

**Narrator**:
"Traditional employee surveys lack privacy. Employees fear retaliation for honest feedback. This is why we built a privacy-preserving survey platform using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on blockchain."

## Scene 2: Creating a Survey (0:12-0:24)
**Visual**: Demonstrate creating a new survey
- Show "Create Survey" button click
- Display form with survey title "Workplace Satisfaction Q4"
- Add questions like "How satisfied are you with management?"
- Set duration to 7 days

**Narrator**:
"HR managers can create surveys with custom questions. Each survey is deployed to the blockchain with a specific duration. The smart contract ensures complete transparency and immutability."

## Scene 3: Employee Response (0:24-0:38)
**Visual**: Switch to employee view
- Connect wallet
- View available survey
- Submit ratings (1-5 stars) for each question
- Show MetaMask transaction confirmation

**Narrator**:
"Employees connect their wallet and submit encrypted responses. Each rating is encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain. Individual responses remain permanently private, even from administrators."

## Scene 4: Viewing Results (0:38-0:50)
**Visual**: Show aggregated results dashboard
- Display participation count
- Show average ratings per question
- Highlight blockchain transaction confirmations
- Show Etherscan link

**Narrator**:
"After the survey closes, only aggregated statistics are revealed. The platform calculates averages while keeping individual responses encrypted, providing actionable insights without compromising employee privacy."
