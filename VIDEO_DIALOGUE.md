Traditional employee surveys lack privacy. Employees fear retaliation for honest feedback. This is why we built a privacy-preserving survey platform using Fully Homomorphic Encryption on blockchain.

HR managers can create surveys with custom questions. Each survey is deployed to the blockchain with a specific duration. The smart contract ensures complete transparency and immutability.

Employees connect their wallet and submit encrypted responses. Each rating is encrypted using FHE before being stored on-chain. Individual responses remain permanently private, even from administrators.

After the survey closes, only aggregated statistics are revealed. The platform calculates averages while keeping individual responses encrypted, providing actionable insights without compromising employee privacy.

Built on Ethereum with Zama's FHE technology, this platform guarantees mathematical privacy. True anonymity enables honest feedback, helping organizations improve workplace culture.
